# CUSTOM NETWORK

Docker allows us to create custom [bridge](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/) networks so that our containers can communicate with each other if we want them to, but remain otherwise isolated. We're going to build a system where the application servers are hidden within a custom network, and only our load balancer is exposed to the host.

Let's create a custom bridge network called "caddytest".

```bash
docker network create caddytest
```

You can see if it worked by listing all the networks:

```
docker network ls
```

## RESTART YOUR APPLICATION SERVERS ON THE NETWORK

Stop and restart your caddy application servers, but this time, make sure you attach them to the `caddytest` network and give them names:

```bash
docker run -d --network caddytest --name caddy1 -p 8001:80 -v "$PWD/i
ndex1.html:/usr/share/caddy/index.html" caddy
```

```bash
docker run -d --network caddytest --name caddy2 -p 8002:80 -v "$PWD/
index2.html:/usr/share/caddy/index.html" caddy
```
## CONTACTING THE CADDY SERVERS THROUGH THE BRIDGE

To make sure it's working, let's get a shell session inside a "getting started" container on the custom network:

```bash
docker run -it --network caddytest docker/getting-started /bin/sh
```

By giving our containers some names, `caddy1` and `caddy2`, and providing a bridge network, Docker has set up name resolution for us! The container names resolve to the individual containers from all other containers on the network. Within your `docker/getting-started` container shell, [curl](https://curl.se/) the first container:

```bash
curl caddy1
```

And the second container:

```bash
curl caddy2
```

If you get the HTML responses that you expect, you're done!

```bash
 (main) dev@THEHENNYMACHINE$~/workspace/boot.dev/Docker/2. test load balancer$ docker run -d --network caddytest --name caddy1 -p 8001
:80 -v "$PWD/index1.html:/usr/share/caddy/index.html" caddy
