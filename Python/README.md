# Python Study Materials

This directory contains all of my study materials for the Python programming as well as personal projects created during self-learning.

## Contents

- **Projects**: This folder contains Python projects created by myself during self-learning
- **Practice**: This folder contains Python scripts demonstrating various concepts and techniques for practice
- **Notes**: This folder contains notes on Python programming.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in this directory corresponds to a different type of material (scripts, exercises, or notes). Inside each subdirectory, you'll find relevant Python files and a `README.md` file with more information.

## Requirements

These materials were created using Python 3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed and set as your default Python interpreter.
