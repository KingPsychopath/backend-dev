GitHub Copilot: The active selection is a Python script that tests the functionality of three classes: `Vehicle`, `Truck`, and `Car`. These classes are defined elsewhere and are imported at the start of the script with `from main import *`.

The `Vehicle` class is the base class, and `Truck` and `Car` are subclasses that inherit from `Vehicle`. Each class has a method `get_price_for_trip(distance_kilometers, price_per_liter)` that calculates the cost of a trip based on the distance and the price per liter of fuel. The `Truck` class has an additional cost factor based on the load weight.

The script defines two lists of test cases, `run_cases` and `submit_cases`. Each test case is a tuple that includes an instance of a vehicle, a distance for the trip, a price per liter of fuel, and the expected cost of the trip.

The `test()` function takes one of these test cases as input. It prints out the details of the test case, calculates the actual cost of the trip using the `get_price_for_trip()` method of the vehicle, and checks if the actual cost matches the expected cost. If they match, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. If an error occurs during the test, it's caught and reported, and the test is marked as failed.

The `main()` function runs all the test cases in a specified list and keeps track of how many tests pass and how many fail. It prints out a summary of the results at the end.

The list of test cases to run is determined by whether the `__RUN__` variable is defined in the global scope. If it is, `run_cases` is used; otherwise, `submit_cases` is used. The `main()` function is then called to run the tests.
