Recursive String Reversal

At Doc2Doc we need to be able to reverse strings. Our bad-word detection algorithms need to work on those crazy teenagers who write unpleasantries backward to try to get around our filters!

However, being an ex-Haskell-loving university professor, our team lead has asked us to implement it using recursion instead of loop.
Assignment

Complete the reverse_string function.

It should take a string as a parameter and return the reversed string by recursively reversing the substrings inside. Your function should recurse once for each character in the string.
