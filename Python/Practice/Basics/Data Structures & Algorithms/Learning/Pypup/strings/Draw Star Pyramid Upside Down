"""
The provided Python code defines a function named print_reversed_star_pyramid that takes an integer n as an argument and prints a reversed star pyramid with n rows.

The function works by using a for loop that iterates from n down to 1 (inclusive). The range of the loop is defined by range(n, 0, -1), which starts at n, ends at 0 (exclusive), and decrements by 1 in each iteration.

Inside the loop, the function prints a string that represents a row of the pyramid. This string is composed of two parts:

' ' * (n - i): This creates a string of spaces. The number of spaces is n - i, which decreases in each iteration. This aligns the stars to the right and creates the pyramid shape.

'*' * (2 * i - 1): This creates a string of stars. The number of stars is 2 * i - 1, which is an odd number that decreases by 2 in each iteration. This creates the rows of the pyramid, with each row having one less pair of stars than the row below it.
