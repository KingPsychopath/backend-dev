# Terraform Study Materials

This directory contains all my study materials for the Terraform part of the course.

## Contents

- **Scripts**: This folder contains Terraform scripts demonstrating various Infrastructure as Code techniques.
- **Modules**: This folder contains reusable Terraform modules.
- **Notes**: This folder contains notes on Terraform and Infrastructure as Code.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in this directory corresponds to a different type of material (scripts, modules, or notes). Inside each subdirectory, you'll find relevant Terraform files and a `README.md` file with more information.

## Terraform Version

These materials were created using Terraform 0.14. Make sure you have Terraform 0.14 or later installed.
