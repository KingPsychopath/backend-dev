# Ansible Study Materials

This directory contains all my study materials for the Ansible part of the course.

## Contents

- **Playbooks**: This folder contains Ansible playbooks demonstrating various concepts and techniques.
- **Roles**: This folder contains Ansible roles for reusable configuration management.
- **Notes**: This folder contains notes on Ansible and configuration management.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in this directory corresponds to a different type of material (playbooks, roles, or notes). Inside each subdirectory, you'll find relevant Ansible files and a `README.md` file with more information.

## Ansible Version

These materials were created using Ansible 2.9. Make sure you have Ansible 2.9 or later installed.
