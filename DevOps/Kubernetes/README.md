# Kubernetes Study Materials

This directory contains all my study materials for the Kubernetes part of the course.

## Contents

- **Configurations**: This folder contains YAML configuration files demonstrating various Kubernetes concepts and techniques.
- **Scripts**: This folder contains scripts for managing Kubernetes clusters.
- **Notes**: This folder contains notes on Kubernetes and container orchestration.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in this directory corresponds to a different type of material (configurations, scripts, or notes). Inside each subdirectory, you'll find relevant Kubernetes files and a `README.md` file with more information.

These materials were created using Kubernetes 1.19. Make sure you have Kubernetes 1.19 or later installed.
