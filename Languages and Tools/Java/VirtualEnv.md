Java does not have a built-in feature equivalent to Python's virtual environments. However, there are tools and practices in the Java ecosystem that can help isolate dependencies and configuration in a similar way.

1. **Maven and Gradle**: These are the most commonly used build tools in Java. They both download project-specific dependencies, which are stored separately for each project. This isolates the dependencies of different projects from each other.

2. **Docker**: You can use Docker to create a container for your Java application. The container can include the specific version of Java that your application needs, along with all of its dependencies. This provides a high level of isolation, as the container is completely separate from your main system and other containers.

3. **Jenv**: Jenv is a command line tool that makes it easy to manage multiple versions of Java on a single machine. It's similar to Python's `pyenv`. With Jenv, you can set a global Java version, and also specify different Java versions for different projects.

4. **SDKMAN!**: SDKMAN! is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix-based systems. It provides a convenient command line interface for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates.

Remember, these tools do not provide the same functionality as Python's virtual environments, but they can help manage and isolate Java versions and dependencies in a similar way.
