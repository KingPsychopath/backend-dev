To implement an HTTP service to store objects organized by code repository, you would typically use a web framework in your chosen language, along with a database to store the data. Here's a high-level plan using Python with the Flask web framework and SQLite as the database:

1. Define the data model for the objects to be stored. This should match the specification you've been given.

2. Set up the database and create a table that matches the data model.

3. Create a Flask application and define routes that correspond to the API specification. These routes should handle the HTTP methods specified (GET, POST, etc.).

4. In each route, implement the logic to interact with the database and return the appropriate response.

Here's a simplified example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Repository(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True)
    # Add other fields as per the specification

db.create_all()

@app.route('/repositories', methods=['POST'])
def create_repository():
    data = request.get_json()
    repo = Repository(name=data['name'])  # Add other fields as per the specification
    db.session.add(repo)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({'id': repo.id}), 201

@app.route('/repositories/<int:repo_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_repository(repo_id):
    repo = Repository.query.get_or_404(repo_id)
    return jsonify({'name': repo.name})  # Add other fields as per the specification

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code creates a Flask application with two routes: one for creating a new repository (POST /repositories) and one for retrieving a repository by its ID (GET /repositories/<id>). The data is stored in a SQLite database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Please note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle cases where fields might be missing or where the data might not match the expected shape. You might also need to handle nested structures or lists of objects.
