I have an odd issue where sometimes Discord will echo my speakers back into my mic. It's quite infrequent, and only reboots solve it. Until now. This batch file restarts several Windows audio services and other audio services, which fix the issue. It can fix other audio errors as well.

I wrote it so that it won't do anything if you don't launch it as an administrator, as many PCs are setup to require an elevated command prompt for this to work.
